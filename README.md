# FindSets

An algorithm developed by me to find all independent maximal sets of a graph.

## Instructions

### Basics

Given a graph, by entering its cordinates or adjancency matrix, the program returns all sizes of alpha(G), i(G) and which M the graph belongs to. Select the option to read, to print the information regarding the graphs select the option to print. You can read more than one graphs.

To see the sets uncomment the line 253.

### Compiling

In the directory.

./compile_findsets.sh

and execute the findSets file.

./findSets

## Version 1.5 | Options 

- Read Graph.
- Read Graph and multiply by K2. (Cartesian Product)
- Read Graph using Adjancy Matrix.
- Generate a random Graph.
- Print Alpha and I of all graphs tested.

## Version in Development

Any bug or problem, please report.
