# Find_IndSets
An algorithm developed by me to find all independent maximal sets of a graph.


## Instructions

Given a graph, by entering its cordinates the program returns all sizes of alpha(G), i(G) and which M the graph belongs to. 

## Version 1.5

- Options 

-- Read Graph.
-- Read Graph and multiply by K2. (Cartesian Product)
-- Read Graph using Adjancy Matrix.
-- Generate a random Graph.
-- Print Alpha and I of all graphs tested.
